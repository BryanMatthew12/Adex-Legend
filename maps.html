                <p>
                    Grand Westalis is a two site map (A and B) that has attackers infiltrating from a beach coast.
                    Site A is accessible through an alleyway in the middle of the map called “short A” or through
                    a building’s hallway called, “showers”. Site B is accessible by a path along the beach
                    called “long B” or through a marketplace and window called “hookah”. A unique aspect of
                    this map is that there are two one-way teleporters. One teleporter takes you from long B to
                    the attacker’s side of showers. The other takes you from short A to the attacker’s side of
                    hookah. These allow both attackers and defenders alike to quickly rotate or flank the
                    opposing team.The teleporter is incredibly noisy so it is somewhat risky to do so if your
                    enemies are expecting it. You can also throw projectiles, drones, and guns through
                    teleporters. One ultimate orb can be found inside the showers while the other is at long B
                    right in front of the teleporter.

                    Waterway. This map is by far the most unique and unconventional tactical shooter maps
                    that Riot have released. The map is suffering a ‘fracture’ at its center which leaves it
                    mimicking the shape of the letter H. Weirdly enough, defenders are spawned in at the very
                    middle of the map whilst attackers can choose to begin their round on either side of the
                    center (by navigating a massive zipline). This weird setup at the start of rounds makes
                    things tough for defenders and balances out the traditional sided favoritism. There is a
                    wide variety of potential strategies for both defenders and attackers since there are simply
                    more entry points, chokepoints and pathways to bombsites than other maps.

                    Paradise Falls is the best map overall. It is large, wide, and kind of bland. There really isn't
                    all that much to see here, though its wide-open spaces do juxtapose nicely with the
                    laneways you can see on the Mini-Map (but we'll get to that in a minute). When playing
                    on higher combat pacing this map can be relatively nice, but so far we are relatively
                    unimpressed.

                    The city is notably the biggest bastion of the forces that oppose the Red Army, and is also
                    the home of the King's Palace Army, who had been in battle since the Black Dragon Raid
                    fifty years ago. Currently, they are thwarting the expansion efforts of the Dark Overlord
                    Army and the Red Army, the latter of which continues to persist through time.
